Welcome to this repository
This project was just made for the sole purpose of implementing the basic OOPs concepts of Object Oriented Programming using Java.
We have 5 Classes Bonds, Properties, Stocks and Commodities
We have investors coming up and changing their data and a login interface for accessing their respective portfolios.
It was implemented by first drawing a Use Case Diagram.
